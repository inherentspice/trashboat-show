What is the band?', answer: "My Chemical Romance: The band was formed by frontman Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier in Newark, New Jersey, soon after the September 11 attacks. Witnessing the World Trade Center towers fall influenced Way's life to the extent that he decided to start a band. Shortly thereafter, Ray Toro was recruited as the band's guitarist because at the time Way could not sing and play the guitar simultaneously. Way has said, 'Music was this thing I secretly wanted to do' and later wrote the song 'Skylines and Turnstiles' to express his feelings about September 11."},

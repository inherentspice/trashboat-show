Witnessing the World Trade Center towers fall influenced Way's life to the extent that he decided to start a band. Shortly thereafter, Ray Toro was recruited as the band's guitarist because at the time Way could not sing and play the guitar simultaneously. Way has said, 'Music was this thing I secretly wanted to do' and later wrote the song 'Skylines and Turnstiles' to express his feelings about September 11."},
